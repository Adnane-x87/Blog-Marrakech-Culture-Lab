## Identify the Primary User

## Persona 1: Yasmine, the Cultural Explorer

### Age/Context
- Age: 28 years old
- Occupation: Freelance graphic designer living in Marrakech
- Lifestyle: Active in the local creative scene, attends 2-3 cultural events per month
- Tech usage: Uses smartphone primarily (android), checks social media and event platforms daily during commute and coffee breaks

### Main Objective
Discover upcoming cultural and artistic events in Marrakech quickly and decide which ones to attend based on community recommendations and her interests.

### Key Needs (3 max)
- **Browse current and upcoming events easily** – See what's happening this week/month in Marrakech's cultural scene (exhibitions, concerts, theater, workshops) without having to check multiple sources.
- **Filter by interest and date** – Quickly find events that match her interests (contemporary art, music, photography) and fit her schedule.
- **See community engagement** – Know which events are popular or recommended by other culture enthusiasts to help her decide what's worth attending.

### Main Frustration
"Information is scattered everywhere!" – Event details are spread across multiple Facebook pages, Instagram accounts, and different websites. She often discovers interesting events too late or misses them entirely because there's no centralized, updated platform.

### Environment
- Device: Primarily mobile android, occasionally checks on laptop
- Connection: Good WiFi at home/cafés, 4G when moving around the city
- Usage pattern: Quick 5-10 minute browsing sessions during breaks, searching for "what to do this weekend"

## Persona 2: Karim, the Event Organizer

### Age/Context
- Age: 35 years old
- Occupation: Cultural event organizer & manager of a small art gallery in Gueliz
- Lifestyle: Organizes 4-6 events per year (exhibitions, artist talks, workshops), collaborates with local artists and venues
- Tech usage: Uses laptop for work, smartphone for quick updates, active on social media for promotion

### Main Objective
Promote his cultural events to the right audience in Marrakech and increase visibility and attendance without spending too much time or money on marketing.

### Key Needs (3 max)
- **Easy event publication** – Quickly post event details (date, location, description, images) to reach the cultural community in one place.
- **Reach the right audience** – Connect with people genuinely interested in art and culture in Marrakech, not just random followers.
- **Track engagement** – See how many people are interested, planning to attend, or sharing his events to measure impact.

### Main Frustration
"Promoting events takes too much effort for too little reach!" – He has to post on multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp groups), pay for ads, and still struggles to reach beyond his existing network. Small cultural events get lost in the noise.

### Environment
- Device: Laptop for creating events, smartphone for quick responses and updates
- Connection: Good WiFi at gallery/home
- Usage pattern: Posts events 2-3 weeks in advance, checks engagement daily, responds to inquiries
